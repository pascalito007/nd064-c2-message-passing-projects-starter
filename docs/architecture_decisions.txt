Message passing strategy decision justification

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) technique

RESTful APIs are the most common form of message passing today.
It can be implemented in many ways and the industry has settled on the best practices on how to implement REST APIs

gRPC (g* Remote Procedure Calls) technique

gRPC is programming language agnostic. Compared to REST, gRPC provides greater performance at the expense of less flexibility.
gRPC does not require an HTTP library to make an API request.

Message Queues (e.g Kafka) technique:

Message Queues has been chosen because it address three main issues: performance, reliability and decoupling.
Queues provide asynchronous request, help to have a system to be always available to clients even if other parts of the service may not be functioning
and finally parts of the system can be modified without affecting others.
